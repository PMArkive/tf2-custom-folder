This was made by a horse.

	How to use:
	1. Make sure the ViewmodelCustomizer folder is inside your custom folder. Do not rename it.
	2. Edit your settings for each animation in 1.Settings.txt. 
	3. Once you set everything, run GENERATE.bat. It will generate 0.CustomizedViewmodels.vpk in your custom folder.
	4. Open up the game and test. If you want to change anything, adjust the settings in 1.Settings.txt again and run
	GENERATE.bat.
	5. If you want to use preloading and have it work in casual, add "exec preloading.cfg" to your autoexec.
